# StudyOrganizer
The StudyOrganizer is a simple console application to organize your online studies during the pandemic time. Save ur all URL-links to a specific project or module. Concludes also a calender, a worktimer, a timetable and a overview for ur grades. Its NOT ready, feel free to work on it. A nice GUI would be awesome.
